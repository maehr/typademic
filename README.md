## Todo

This GitHub template is agnostic to the programming language used, uses GitHub Actions to manage issues and pull requests, and helps enforce best practices for small projects. To use the template, [generate](https://github.com/maehr/github-template/generate) a new project and perform the following tasks.

-   [x] add `Moritz M√§hr`, `maehr`, `typademic` and `SHORT_DESCRIPTION` to [README.md](README.md) and change it according to [www.makeareadme.com](https://www.makeareadme.com/)
-   [x] add `typademic` to [package.json](package.json) according to [npm docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/configuring-npm/package-json)
-   [x] change `moritz.maehr@gmail.com` in [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
-   [x] use [www.gitignore.io](https://www.gitignore.io/) to enhance [.gitignore](.gitignore)
-   [x] use [gitattributes.io](https://gitattributes.io/) to enhance [.gitattributes](.gitattributes)
-   [ ] add example environment variables to [example.env](example.env)
-   [ ] add [GitHub actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) in `.github/workflows/` according to [starter-workflows](https://github.com/actions/starter-workflows)
-   [ ] activate [gh-pages](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages)
-   [ ] [protect](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-protected-branches) the main branch to enforce a [fork and pull](https://gist.github.com/Chaser324/ce0505fbed06b947d962) workflow
-   [ ] activate [GitHub security alerts](https://github.blog/2017-11-16-introducing-security-alerts-on-github/) and change [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) accordingly
-   [ ] add favicons to `./`, for example via [favicon.io](https://favicon.io/)
